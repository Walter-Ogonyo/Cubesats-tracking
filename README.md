# Cubesats-tracking
GPS module is programmed on the Arduino board to obtain Almanac data from the surrounding satellites.
The data is used by the GPS to estimate the position of the satellite and is presented in the NMEA format
A GPS library is created to carry the output data 
Data from the library is then transmitted to the Ground station for monitoring and interpretation
